# Overview

This Charm simulates an SSE endpoint so SSE consumers can relate to it and recieve the connection information.

Use this charm when you want SSE consumers to connect to an external SSE endpoint which isn't managed by Juju. Set the `base-url` config option to the url of the real SSE endpoint.
